<p>Paul returned to Jerusalem with Barnabas and Titus after 14 years. The purpose of his visit was to ensure that the gospel he had been preaching among the Gentiles was correct. However, there were false brothers who preached salvation by circumcision, to which Paul did not yield at all to. The influential saw that the gospel had been entrusted to Paul to the uncircumcised as it had been to Peter to the circumcised. James, Cephas, and John noticed that grace had been given to Paul, and they sent him to go to the Gentiles while they went to the circumcised. <strong>v.1-10</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paul returned to Jerusalem after preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles for 14 years
<ul>
<li>Barnabas with him</li>
<li>Brought Titus with him</li>
<li>Reason for the return was because of a revelation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paul meets with the influential in the church privately
<ul>
<li>Presented the gospel he had been preaching to make sure it was correct</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Titus was not forced to be circumcised
<ul>
<li>Titus is a Greek</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>False brothers were secretly brought in
<ul>
<li>Spy out the freedom we have in Christ</li>
<li>Bring us back into slavery</li>
<li>Did not yield for a moment to them
<ul>
<li>Reason was so that the gospel may be preserved for the Galatians</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The influential did not add anything to Paul
<ul>
<li>Whoever is influential makes no difference to Paul
<ul>
<li>God shows no partiality</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The influential saw the contrary
<ul>
<li>Saw that the gospel had been entrusted to Paul to the Gentiles
<ul>
<li>Like the way the gospel had been entrusted to Peter to the Jews</li>
<li>God works in both Peter and Paul&rsquo;s apostolic ministry to their respective audience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>James, Cephas John perceived the grace given to Paul
<ul>
<li>The three were pillars of the church in Jerusalem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paul and Barnabas sent to preach the gospel to the Gentiles</li>
<li>The others in Jerusalem to preach the gospel to the Jews</li>
<li>Only thing they asked of Paul to do was to remember the poor</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The False Gospel:</strong> Salvation by circumcision and not purely by faith.</p>
<p>When Cephas arrived in Antioch, there was a time where he was eating with the Gentiles. However, once men from James came, he separated himself from the uncircumcised. Paul called Cephas out for his hypocrisy. If Cephas was living like a Gentile, how could he expect Gentiles to live like Jews? <strong>v.11-14</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cephas came to Antioch
<ul>
<li>Opposed by Paul
<ul>
<li>Stood condemned</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cephas was eating with the Gentiles</li>
<li>Cephas separated himself from the Gentiles when men from James came
<ul>
<li>Feared the circumcision party</li>
<li>Led the rest of the Jews and Barnabas to do the same</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conduct not in step with the gospel
<ul>
<li>Paul publicly rebuked Cephas</li>
<li>Cannot force the Gentiles to live like Jews if Jews live like Gentiles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A person is justified by faith and not by works by believing in Jesus Christ. No one will be justified by the law. We die to the law so that we may live in Christ. It is not Paul who lives but Christ who lives in him. If righteousness came through the law then the death of Christ is meaningless. <strong>v.15-21</strong></p>
<p><strong>The True Gospel:</strong> Salvation is by faith alone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul and the brothers are Jews by birth
<ul>
<li>Not Gentile sinners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Know that justification not from works of the law but from faith in Christ</li>
<li>Believe in Christ to be justified by faith</li>
<li>No one is justified by works of the law</li>
<li>Is Christ a servant of sin if we are found to be sinners in our endeavour to be justified in Christ?
<ul>
<li>No</li>
<li>If Paul rebuilds what he tore down, it is proof that he is transgressor</li>
<li>Died to the law through the law
<ul>
<li>Reason so that Paul may live to God</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crucified with Christ</li>
<li>Not Paul who lives, but Christ who lives in him</li>
<li>Life he lives in the flesh is being lived by faith in the Son</li>
<li>God loved Paul and gave himself for Paul</li>
<li>Paul does not nullify the grace of God
<ul>
<li>If righteousness was through the law, then the death of Christ is meaningless</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
