<p>Brothers need to restore each other in gentleness should any of them sin. Furthermore, while they share each other&rsquo;s burdens, they must keep in mind that they are held accountable to their own work. Whatever one sows they will reap. Do good to everyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who are spiritual should restore those who transgress
<ul>
<li>Spirit of gentleness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure as an individual we are not tempted</li>
<li>Bear each other&rsquo;s burdens
<ul>
<li>Fulfil the law of Christ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deceives himself whenever anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing</li>
<li>Each should test own work
<ul>
<li>Reason to boast will be in himself
<ul>
<li>Not in his neighbour</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each has to bear own load</li>
<li>One who is taught the word share all good things with the teacher</li>
<li>God is not mocked
<ul>
<li>Whatever you sow you will reap</li>
<li>One who sows flesh will reap corruption
<ul>
<li>From the flesh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One who sows to the Spirit will reap internal life
<ul>
<li>From the Spirit</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not grow weary of doing good
<ul>
<li>Will reap in due season if don&rsquo;t give up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do good to everyone
<ul>
<li>Especially to the household of faith</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul summarizes his letter. The ones preaching circumcision want to make a showing for themselves. But Paul will boast in nothing except in the cross of Christ. Paul bears the marks of Christ on his body. He ends his letter by wishing the brothers peace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who force them to be
circumcised
<ul>
<li>In order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those who are circumcised do not keep the law
<ul>
<li>Desire to have others circumcised so they may boast in others' flesh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paul will not boast except in the cross of Jesus
<ul>
<li>World has been crucified to him</li>
<li>Paul has been crucified to the world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Circumcision nor uncircumcision count for anything
<ul>
<li>Only the new creation counts</li>
<li>Anyone who walks by this rule Paul wishes peace and mercy on them
<ul>
<li>Also on the Israel of God</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paul wishes the grace of Jesus be with the brothers' spirit</li>
</ul>
