<p>For the Galatians in the church, they were there as witnesses to the public crucifixion of Christ. Yet, the Spirit was given to them because of faith. If it was by works, then their suffering is in vain. Just as Abraham believed and God was counted as righteous, so do the Galatians receive the Spirit from God by faith. The Scriptures foretold that God would also justify the Gentiles by faith. Those who are blessed are those like Abraham - they have faith. <strong>v.1-9</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Galatians bore witness to the public crucifixion of Christ</li>
<li>Is the Spirit received by works of the law or hearing by faith?</li>
<li>If you started with the spirit, are you becoming perfected in the flesh?</li>
<li>Was all the suffering for Christ in vain?</li>
<li>Does the one who give the Spirit and do miracles among the church do so by the
law or by faith?
<ul>
<li>Like Abraham, who believed and it was counted to him as righteousness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those who are of faith are the sons of Abraham</li>
<li>Scripture foretold what God would do for the Gentiles
<ul>
<li>The gospel as preached to Abraham was simply that in him the nations will
be blessed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People who are blessed with Abraham are those of faith like Abraham</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who relies on works of the law is under a curse. Christ redeemed the
church from the curse of the law, fulfilling the law in the process. Because of
Jesus, even the Gentiles are able to receive the Spirit through faith.</p>
<ul>
<li>All who rely on the works of the law are under a curse
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book
of &ldquo;the Law, and do them&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No one is justified before God by the law
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The righteous shall live by faith&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Law is not of faith
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The one who does them shall live by them&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Christ redeemed the church from the curse of the law
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree&rdquo;</li>
<li>Blessing of Abraham may come to Gentiles</li>
<li>That Gentiles may receive the Spirit through faith</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with a man-made covenant, it is not changed or nullified once it has been
made. Likewise, the law came which 430 years after the promise does not nullify
the covenant made by God. Rather, the law was added because of transgressions
until Christ should come. This was necessary so that the promise could be given
through Christ by faith. The law was like a guardian until Christ, so that we
are no longer under guardianship but sons of God through faith. There is no
distinction - all who believe are Abraham&rsquo;s offspring and heirs.</p>
<ul>
<li>No one adds to or nullifies a man-made covenant after ratification</li>
<li>Promises were made to Abraham and his offspring
<ul>
<li>Not plural offspring</li>
<li>Singular offspring, referring to Christ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Mosaic Covenant (the Law) came 430 years after the promise was given
<ul>
<li>Does not nullify the covenant with Abraham</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inheritance given to Abraham by promise
<ul>
<li>Inheritance does not come by the law</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Law was added because of transgressions
<ul>
<li>Only until when Christ comes</li>
<li>Put in place through angels by intermediary
<ul>
<li>Implies more than one, but God is one</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is the law contrary to the promises of God?
<ul>
<li>No</li>
<li>Would be contrary if law was given to give life
<ul>
<li>Righteousness by the law</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scripture imprisoned everything under sin</li>
<li>Promise by faith in Christ may be given to those who believe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under the law everyone held captive under the law
<ul>
<li>Law was guardian until Christ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Faith has come, no longer under a guardian
<ul>
<li>Through faith we are sons of God</li>
<li>As many as those who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No distinction between social or ethnic groups
<ul>
<li>All one in Christ</li>
<li>All Abraham&rsquo;s offspring</li>
<li>All heirs according to the promise</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
