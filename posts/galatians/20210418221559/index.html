They now know God, but want to go back into enslavement. Thus, Paul is afraid he has laboured in vain. Paul pleads with the Galatians to turn back to the Gospel, back to the love and blessedness they once showed. The Galatians returning to enslavement brings much anguish to Paul that he likens it to childbirth, waiting for until they become like Christ.</p><ul><li>When they did not know God they were enslaved to the world</li><li>Now they do know God, but they are returning back to the world</li><li>Paul is afraid that his work over them was in vain</li><li>Paul pleads with the Galatians to become like Paul<ul><li>Like how Paul had become like them</li></ul></li><li>Paul first preached to Gospel to the Galatians because of a bodily ailment<ul><li>Paul wasn&rsquo;t in the best shape but the Galatians still received him</li></ul></li><li>The Galatians back then would have given themselves up for Paul</li><li>It is good to be made much of for a good purpose<ul><li>The enemies of God shut the Galatians out so the Galatians can make much of them</li></ul></li><li>Paul is in the anguish of childbirth<ul><li>Waiting for Christ to be formed in the Galatians</li></ul></li><li>Wishes he could be present with them<ul><li>Wants to change his tone to one who is perplexed</li></ul></li></ul><p>Paul likens the action of the Galatians to the narrative of Abraham and Hagar. The child of Hagar was one of the flesh while Isaac was of the promise. They are likened to Mount Sinai and the Jerusalem above respectively. The Galatians are like Isaac - children of the promise. The children of the flesh, like back then, will be cast out. Therefore, to listen to the law is to not be under the law.</p><ul><li>Abraham had two sons<ul><li>One by a slave woman (Hagar)<ul><li>Born of the flesh</li></ul></li><li>One by a free woman (Sarah)<ul><li>Born through promise</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Corresponds to two covenants<ul><li>Mount Sinai (Hagar)<ul><li>Corresponds to present Jerusalem</li><li>In slavery with her children</li></ul></li><li>Jerusalem above (Sarah)<ul><li>Mother of those in Christ</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Galatians like Isaac - children of promise</li><li>Son of Hagar persecuted son of Sarah<ul><li>Likewise in the present time</li></ul></li><li>Slave woman and her son to be cast out<ul><li>No inheritance with the son of the free woman</li></ul></li><li>We are not children of the slave but of the free woman</li></ul></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/galatians>galatians</a></li><li><a href=/tags/c4>c4</a></li><li><a href=/tags/nt>nt</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>Â© Copyright notice | <a href=https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil>Ezhil theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
