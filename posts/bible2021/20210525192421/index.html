They are washed and clothed with the priest&rsquo;s garments. Then all the items in the tabernacle were consecrated with the anointing oil. Before anointing Aaron and his sons, the sin offering was offered, followed by the burnt offering and the ram of ordination and wave offering. They stayed in the tent of meeting during their time of consecration for the seven days that God commanded. After that, Aaron performed his duties as a priest for the first time. A sin offering and a burnt offering was offered for himself. Then he offered the sin offering, the grain offering, the peace offering, and finally the wave offering for the people. They obeyed everything that God commanded. In response, God appeared before the people. The immediate response was one of worship and submission. When Nadab and Abihu died for offering unauthorized incense, God and Moses emphasize the distinction between the holy and common things. They emphasize that their portion of the offerings are also holy. However, Aaron did not eat his portion of the sin offering due to losing his two sons.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210524121321/>previous</a>
