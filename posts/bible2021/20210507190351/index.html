God promises that he will go down with them to Egypt, and by his hand, he will bring Jacob back up. Of the 70 who went down to Egypt, roughly half belonged to the offspring of Leah, who was loved less. Joseph rides out to meet his father, sharing an emotional reunion with him after being apart for so long. He talks to Pharaoh on behalf of his family so that he can give them the land of Goshen. Pharaoh gives his permission, and the people of Israel settle in Goshen, the best land available. As the famine worsens, the people of Egypt spent all their money in buying food. They then exchange their livestock for food and when that has run out, they offer their land and themselves. Curiously, the final transaction is the only one to indicate that Joseph was the one buying the people rather than the people buying food. The people were bought and since they belonged to Pharaoh, a fifth of their harvest was given to Pharaoh. Finally, by God&rsquo;s blessing, the people of Israel were fruitful and multiplied.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210506184353/>previous</a>
