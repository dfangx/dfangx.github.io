<p>Elihu finally decides to speak up. He is angry at Job&rsquo;s friends for failing to find an answer to Job and is angry at Job for justifying himself rather than God. Against Job&rsquo;s friends, he makes it a point to say that he is younger than them. Since they have found no answer to Job, he shall speak. Elihu&rsquo;s rebuke against Job can be contrasted against the other friends. Whereas his friends make accusations against Job, Elihu rebukes him by saying that God talks to man in many ways. Often, God is speaking but man does not perceive it. Sometimes, God speaks through the pain. Not only that, but God can restore man to righteousness, but that is based on whether a suitable ransom is found. Against Job&rsquo;s complaint to God, Elihu asserts the justice of God. Someone who carries out justice does not hate justice, so God will not pervert justice. Rather, God will repay whatever work man has done. God does hear the cry of the poor and will punish the wicked, but he cannot be condemned if he decides to stay quiet for the time being.</p>
