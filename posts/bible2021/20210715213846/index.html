Although Ruth had lost her husband, and Naomi had lost her family, land, and people, God took them from where they were in Moab and moved them back into Israel at a time when the harvest was good. He brought Boaz into Ruth&rsquo;s life when she needed to support herself and Naomi, and set the conditions such that the closest redeemer would decline to redeem her so Boaz could. It is revealed at the very end that this set the stage for the birth of David. God is not only present, but he shows us a glimpse of the conduct of a godly man. This is in contrast to the descriptions in Judges - Boaz cares for Ruth although she a foreigner and performs his duty as a redeemer, just as how God cared for others previously in the Bible and redeemed Israel from Egypt. The blessing to Boaz and Ruth is unique so far, as it recalls the blessings from God to their ancestors. Curiously, they mention women rather than men.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210714230059/>previous</a>
