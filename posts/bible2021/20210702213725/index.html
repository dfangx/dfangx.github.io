However, the Gibeonites deceived Israel into sparing them, showing the dangers of relying on oneself instead of God. The Giveonites were forced to do labour for Israel. In the battle against the five kings, Joshua commanded the sun to stand still. The writer makes note that it was not this phenomenon that made the day unique, but it was the fact that God listened to man. Even when Moses parted the Red Sea, that was at the command of God. Such are the miracles that can happen when God fights for you. As per the command of God through Moses, Joshua executed the five kings. Like Ai, their kings were hung on a tree, and as such would be considered cursed as per the Levitical law. The cities of these kings were devoted to destruction. Joshua then leads Israel through a series of conquests through southern and northern Canaan. Against all, odds Israel defeated their enemies even though they were vastly outnumbered. Using Israel, God judged the Canaanites for their sin.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210701212853/>previous</a>
