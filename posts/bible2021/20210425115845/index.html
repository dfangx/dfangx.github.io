He also promises to bless him and all the earth through him. Abram obeys God and eventually arrives into the land of Canaan, which God promises to give to his offspring. However, immediately after these promises, he fears for his life in the land of Egypt, and lies to save his life. Abram and Lot split afterwards, for the land could not support both of them at once. Lot chose to go east where the land was good, but there was great wickedness. Lot settled among those people. In the meantime, Abram took the west. God again promises to give the land to him and his offspring. Unfortunately, the land which Lot settled in was at war, and he was captured as part of a failed rebellion by the kings of the land. Abram rescues Lot, and he is greeted by the king of Sodom and Salem. A blessing was given to Abram, and Abram gave a tenth of everything to Melchizedek. God formalized his covenant with Abraham afterwards - that his offspring will take possession of the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates. Abram&rsquo;s belief was counted to him as righteousness. God also reveals to Abram the suffering his offspring would go through before inheriting the land.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210424120245/>previous</a>
