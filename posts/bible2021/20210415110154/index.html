Zopher mocks Job in response, saying that Job is already getting repaid much less than his guilt deserves. Like the others, he insists that Job must repent in order for God to lift him up again. When compared to the responses of the other friends so far, Zophar spares nothing for the suffering Job. In response, Job maintains that whatever his friends know about God he does as well. However, what he knows and what he sees appear very different, especially when he knows that God is sovereign. Despite this, Job still appeals to God, placing his hope that God will tell him what he has done wrong. This is contrary to what his friends ask him to do, as they ask him to find his sin by humbling himself before God, whereas Job does this by an appeal.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210414115816/>previous</a>
