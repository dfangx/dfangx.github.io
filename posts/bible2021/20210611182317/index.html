Afterwards, the people became impatient at their journey and grumbled against God and Moses. God sent serpents as judgement. The people repent and God tells Moses to make a serpent on a pole. Anyone who looks at it will live. Curiously, the words of the people of Israel are reminiscent of Pharoah&rsquo;s words to Moses. In addition, the bronze serpent was for people who were bitten, not people who were not bitten. Israel defeated King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan by God&rsquo;s hand. Moab heard of the Israelite advance, and they were filled with great fear. Balak, king of Moab, sends for Balaam. God tells Balaam to not go to Balak. However, he eventually goes after asking God a second time, which is an example of someone knowing what God wants while still desiring to disobey for personal gain. God was angry that Balaam decided to go, and Balaam was almost killed three times if not for his donkey. Only when God reveals himself to Balaam does he realize he sinned, and commits to saying only the things which God tells him to say.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210610222550/>previous</a>
