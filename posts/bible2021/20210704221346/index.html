Following the allotment of Judah, the tribes Ephraim and Manasseh received their portion. It is here that Joshua carried out the decision made by God and Moses regarding the daughters of Zelophehad. When the allotment was given, the Manasseh and Ephraim complained that what they received was only one portion for the both of them. Thus, Joshua gave them the hill country and the tribes were told to subdue the land there. It also appears that while the land was subdued, the tribes took no action to claim it until Joshua commanded it. God had given them the land, but the tribes took no action to settle in it. After Joshua commanded it, the allotment to Benjamin was given. Notably, it is noted that several times, there were several Canaanites that were not driven out, but put them to forced labour.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210703204917/>previous</a>
