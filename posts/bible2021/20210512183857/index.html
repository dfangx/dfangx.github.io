<p>During the plague of locusts, Pharaoh&rsquo;s servants urge Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go. At this point, the economy of Egypt was ruined. Even then, Pharaoh tries to bargain with God. During the plague of darkness, Pharaoh gives his ultimatum to Moses - accept his compromise or die. The final plague is threatened, this time on the god Pharaoh himself. These were all done so that God&rsquo;s power may be known to the Egyptians and that God may draw a distinction between Israel and the Egyptians. The first Passover is observed. A lamb killed at twilight, roasted and then eaten with unleavened bread. The observers were all dressed to leave. The blood of the lamb on the door post served as a sign for God to spare that house from judgement. We are reminded that all of these plagues serve as judgement on the gods of Egypt. This rite was given to all Israel - only those marked with circumcision were to partake of it. The tenth plague, the death of the firstborn, was carried out. Israel was allowed to leave Egypt, plundering Egypt of its wealth, as God said. Just as God told Abraham, God visited his people and brought them out of Egypt after 400 years.</p>
