Whereas the others launched accusations, Elihu acknowledges the suffering that Job is going through. He also states that whether one is righteous or wicked, none of those can profit God. Instead of accusing Job for having sinned, his accusation is that Job believes he is entitled to an answer from God. Thus, he is speaking ignorantly, forgetting the majesty, sovereignty, and power of God. Elihu begins to describe the greatness of God, heavily emphasizing the justice of God. God is just, and in light of suffering, Job must remember and have faith that this is indeed true. Elihu continues to extol the majesty of God. There is a magnificent description of the authority of God over all creation, with Elihu telling Job to consider all the wonderful things that God does and is. Everything in the creation of God moves in accordance to the word and actions of God. In light of Job&rsquo;s suffering, Elihu reminds Job that there are many things that he does not know and cannot give an answer to when it comes to what God does.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210421110007/>previous</a>
