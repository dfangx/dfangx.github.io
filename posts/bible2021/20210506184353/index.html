The brothers beg Jacob to let Benjamin go with them, with Judah offering to take the blame should anything happen to him. Jacob reluctantly agrees, sending with them choice gifts. He recognizes that he and his family are in the mercy of God by the lord of Egypt. Naturally, the brothers are afraid when Joseph brings them to his house. They eat together, and it is at this feast where we further see the divide between the Hebrews and the Egyptians. Joseph now tests them to see if they truly have changed. He witnesses their defence of Benjamin and is overcome with emotion. Joseph reveals his identity to his brothers. Having realized that the events that transpired in the past was the work of God so that a remnant may be saved, he reveals this to his brothers and tells them to bring their families and father to Egypt. Jacob and his family thus begins the migration from a land of famine to a land of providence.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210505211304/>previous</a>
