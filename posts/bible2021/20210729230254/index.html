<p>The news of Saul&rsquo;s death reached David by an Amalekite. The Amalekite lied about how Saul died, potentially trying to earn favour with David. However, David kills him for raising his hand against God&rsquo;s anointed. David writes a lamentation over Saul and Jonathan. Even though Saul had spent much of his life trying to kill David, David still grieves for Saul, remembering Saul for his prowess in battle and the prosperity he brought to Israel. After this, David was made king over Judah, while Saul&rsquo;s son Ish-bosheth was made king over Israel. The two houses immediately begin fighting, ending with Israel&rsquo;s defeat and Judah&rsquo;s victory. However, Asahel was killed. Ish-bosheth then loses the favour of Abner, who defects to David. David welcomes him, but Joab was not happy when he heard about it upon returning from a raid. He murders Abner as revenge for his brother. David makes it clear that it was not his will to put Abner. Being aware of his position, he leaves judgement to the sons of Zeruiah to God, as they hold power over the army. Shortly after, Ish-bosheth was murdered by two captains, who were then killed by David for murdering an innocent person.</p>
