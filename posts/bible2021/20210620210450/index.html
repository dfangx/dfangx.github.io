He emphasizes the setting which the covenant was made in and the people&rsquo;s reaction to it. God was pleased with the hearts of the Israelites at that time, when Israel rightfully feared and revered him. Moses reminds them of who God is and how they are to love God with all their heart, soul, and strength. He takes care to let them know that they played no role in building and creating the things they are about to take possession of - God has prepared it all. He warns them against worshipping other gods and testing God, reminding them of what transpired at Massah. The Israelites are to pass on their teachings and experiences of God to their descendants, and remember the place from which they came from. Moses reminds the people that they are God&rsquo;s treasured possession, not because of anything they&rsquo;ve done, but because of who God is. Their story is one of salvation and redemption. The Israelites are warned to completely destroy their enemies, lest they become a snare to Israel and cause them to sin.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210619205527/>previous</a>
