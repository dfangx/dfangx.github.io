Korah was among those who guarded and serviced the holy things. They claimed that since the entire congregation of Israel is holy, Moses and Aaron should not exalt themselves above everyone else. This is likely a false charge, as Moses had already been described as the meekest man on earth. Moses calls on God to show them who he had chosen, using incense as the test. For their sin, God seeks to destroy them again, but Moses once again intercedes for the people of Israel. Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and their households get swallowed up by the earth, and the 250 men offering incense were consumed by fire from God. The burned censers became a symbol that only Aaron and his descendents were allowed to burn incense. The people still grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and because of that, a plague came upon Israel. The plague killed many people before being stopped when Aaron made atonement. To make it clear that Aaron and his house were chosen as priests, God made Aaron&rsquo;s staff bud. The fear of God set in on the people after this.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210608213607/>previous</a>
