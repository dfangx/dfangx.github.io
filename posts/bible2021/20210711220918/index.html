<p>Tola and Jair served as judges for Israel for a number years. After they died, Israel disobeyed God again, so they were given into the hands of the Philistines and Ammonites. Israel cried out to God again, and God told them to cry out to their own gods. Israel repented, and God once again heard their plea. He sent Japheth, the son of a prostitute. Although driven out of his house when he was young, he was called back to lead Israel against the Ammonites. It is revealed that at this point in time, 300 years had passed. The argument which Japheth made for Israel&rsquo;s possession of the land is, in essence, that since God defeated the Ammonite god, Israel&rsquo;s possession of the land was justified. Japheth made a very rash vow to God, which may be telling that he may not be very familiar with who God is, given his upbringing. Nevertheless, God still gave the Ammonites into his hands. Unfortunately, because of his vow, he was forced to sacrifice his daughter. Ephraim then became mad that they didn&rsquo;t get called out to war (they did but didn&rsquo;t respond), so civil war broke out. Many Ephraimites were killed.</p>
