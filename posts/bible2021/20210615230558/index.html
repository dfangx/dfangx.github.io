Balaam and the kings of Midian were killed. However, Moses was angry because they let the women of Midian live - they were the ones who led Israel to sin and provoked the vengeance of God. As such, Moses ordered every female captive who had slept with a man, as well as the young male captives, to be killed. Anyone who had killed someone must purify themselves and camp outside the camp for seven days. Of the plunder, everything must pass through either fire or water to be clean. The plunder is divided into the army&rsquo;s portion and the people&rsquo;s portion. A tribute to God is given from the army&rsquo;s portion and a portion to the Levites is to be given out of the people&rsquo;s portion. Afterwards, the people of Reuben and Gad asked to settle in the land of Gilead. The words used are reminiscent of when Lot chose the land he would head to. The people of Reuben and Gad promise to continue to fight for their brothers until the land is subdued; otherwise, their sin is upon them. Thus the people of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh were settled.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210614222209/>previous</a>
