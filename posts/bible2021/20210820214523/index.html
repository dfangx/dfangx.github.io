<p>At this time, Israel went to war against the Ammonites. However, David stayed in Jerusalem. While David was in Jerusalem, he saw Bathsheba, who was purifying herself from uncleanness. David lay with her and she became pregnant. David then attempted to cover up the pregnancy by calling back Bathsheba&rsquo;s husband Uriah to go home, so it would look like Uriah was the one who got Bathsheba pregnant. When this did not work, David instructed Joab to put Uriah at one of the more dangerous locations of fighting. Uriah was killed, and Bathsheba became David&rsquo;s wife. However, God was not happy about this, and sent Nathan the prophet to rebuke him. Ironically, when David responds to Nathan&rsquo;s story, he unknowingly judged himself. By the Mosaic law, the consequence of adultery was death. God spared David, but as a result of his actions, God promised that his life and family would now be full of strife. In addition, the son that was in Bathsheba was to die. After their son died, Bathsheba became pregnant again, this time giving birth to Solomon. Rabbah was also captured.</p>
