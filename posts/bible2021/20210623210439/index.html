He reminds them that they are to live in the way God commands them because they are a holy people to God, and God has chosen them as a treasured possession. He reminds them of the laws and conduct surrounding the Sabbatical year. They are to care for each other, the poor, and needy. They are to not take advantage of each other and remember that they too were once slaves in Egypt, and that God was the one who redeemed them. The Israelites are to observe the Passover, Feast of Booths, and Feast of Weeks at their appointed times. The sacrifices are to be offered at the appointed place, which God would reveal to them. They are to give back a portion of whatever they received from God as a form of tithe. This was not only devoted to God, but it was done so in a way where the people could take part and enjoy the tithe. A portion of the tithe is to be given to the Levites, as they did not have any part in the inheritance of Israel.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210622183640/>previous</a>
