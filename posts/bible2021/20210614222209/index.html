<p>God details laws concerning offerings at different times of the day and throughout the year. Each offering often includes some sort of animal, grain offering, drink offering, food offering, or sin offering. The Israelites are to give an offering two times a day. Offerings are also to be given every Sabbath and at the beginning of every month. There are also offerings for the Passover, Feast of Weeks, Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, and Feast of Booths. These offerings would have probably served as not only a way for the Israelites to worship God, but also as a way to remind them that they are God&rsquo;s people. The amount of offerings to be offered were probably relatively expensive, so Israel would have been giving quite a substantial amount of their livelihood to God. In addition, God gives instructions regarding vows. Men are to uphold their vows. Women are to do so as well unless there is opposition from the male authority she is under, whether it be her father or husband. The only exception is if a husband opposes it after he has heard of it - then he bears her iniquity.</p>
