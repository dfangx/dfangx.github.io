<p>Instructions for the priests' garments are given. These garments are to be worn by Aaron and his sons. Aaron&rsquo;s garments are to be made of gold, linen, and various yarns. On the jewels on his breastplate are the names of the sons of Israel. Aaron is the representative of the people of Israel - he bears the judgement of the people on his heart. On his robe are pomegranates and bells. On his forehead is a plate which marks him as holy to God, so that the gifts that are brought are accepted by God. Linen undergarments are also made so that he and his sons won&rsquo;t die for exposing their nakedness before God. Instructions for consecration are also given. Aaron and his sons are to be anointed with oil. A bull is used as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering. The blood of a ram marks them as holy. A wave and peace offering is also performed. The rite of ordination lasts seven days. God consecrates all of this so that he may dwell with the people and they may know the LORD their God.</p>
