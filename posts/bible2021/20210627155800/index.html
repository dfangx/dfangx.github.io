These include blessings for their work as well as blessings for their wombs. God promises to protect them and establish them as his holy people. Enemies will not be able to harm them, and they will enjoy prosperity. They will be looked upon as a great nation. However, God will send curses to them should they disobey. These include defeat, pestilence, drought, and many others. When they are under siege, they will resort to cannibalism due to lack of food, and they will be a people serving not God but their enemies. The covenant is renewed in Moab with the new generation, beginning with recounting the miracles in Egypt to the present time. Moses warns them to obey, lest they become like Sodom and Gomorrah. The other nations will see, and they will know that it is because Israel has fallen away from God. All these things that are revealed to Israel are so that Israel may do what has been revealed.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210626204029/>previous</a>
