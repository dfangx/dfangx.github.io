<p>After the events with Bathsheba, David&rsquo;s house falls into turmoil and strife. David&rsquo;s son Amnon loved his sister Tamar. On the advice of Jonadab, David&rsquo;s nephew, he lured Tamar into his room on the pretense of being sick and raped her. After this, Amnon hated her and sent her away. Absalom hears of this and conspires to kill Amnon in vengeance, which he does. Notably, David was inactive during this entire time - there were no consequences or discipline happening. The only thing described of David was that he was angry. Absalom flees to Geshur, and David grieves for his sons. To get David back on his feet, and perhaps to curry more favour with David, Joab sends a widow to tell David to bring Absalom back. David listens, and Absalom is brought back. However, soon after this, Absalom positions himself in the favour of the people of Israel and rebels against David. On hearing this, David flees Jerusalem, weeping as he went. David prays to God to help him, and takes action to position his friends within Absalom&rsquo;s circle as well. Interestingly, after the incident with Bathsheba, David is referred to more often as &lsquo;king&rsquo; rather than his name.</p>
