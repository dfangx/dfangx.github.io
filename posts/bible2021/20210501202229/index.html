<p>From Bilhah on behalf of Rachel, Dan and Naphtali were born. From Zilpah on behalf of Lea, Gad and Asher were born. Leah bore Issachar and Zebulon, as well as a daughter Dinah. Joseph is born to Rachel after. We see that although Jacob loved Rachel more, God shows his blessing to the one unloved. When Jacob desired to return home to his father, Laban tried to keep him, for he saw he became very rich through Jacob. Laban tries to become even richer by trying to take advantage of the deal with Jacob. To counter this, Jacob makes the flock mate in front of striped, speckled, and spotted sticks. At first, it seems this works and the result is that Jacob grew richer. However, it is later revealed that it was God who said what happened would happen. Even if Jacob didn&rsquo;t use any sticks, whatever God said would happen would have happened regardless. Having realizing that Laban was now a danger to him just as Esau once was, Jacob flees from Laban. By God&rsquo;s intervention Jacob was not harmed. A covenant was made between the two groups, where they promised to not harm one another and Jacob would respect Laban as his father in law.</p>
