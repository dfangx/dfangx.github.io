He maintains that his complaints are just and acknowledges once again the sovereignty of God. He maintains that he is still in obedience to God, as he finds the misfortunes that have come upon him to be in God&rsquo;s will. Job challenges his friends to tell him what exactly it is that they are saying God is punishing him for. He goes on to elaborate further the suffering he is going through right now, but ends his response by appealing to God for mercy, for if God does not hear his complaints, then truly his life has no hope. Bildad responds to urges Job to repent. God is just. He does not bring down the righteous. Therefore, since disaster is happening to Job, Job must have sinned. If he repents, then God will listen. But Job replies that no one is right before God. He extols the greatness and the holiness of God. If God is just and holy, then nothing Job says will be of any use. To appeal to Satan (the accuser) wouldn&rsquo;t work either, for Satan will always find something wrong in him. Therefore, there is no one who can arbitrate between Job and God, and he concludes that he must appeal to God for mercy if he maintains that he has not done anything wrong.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210413110106/>previous</a>
