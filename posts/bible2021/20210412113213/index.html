<p>God remembered Noah and those that he had spared from the flood. Therefore, God caused the floodwaters to recede. When land could be seen, Noah sent out a raven and a dove several times, continually checking for the day which the floodwaters completely recede. Once the water had dried up, God let Noah know he could exit the Ark. Noah was given a similar blessing from God as Adam, but with a new commandment: they are not permitted to eat anything with blood still in it, for life is found in the blood. God also lays out the heavy consequence for shedding the blood of man, for man was created in God&rsquo;s image. A covenant was made with between God and Noah, his offspring, and all living creatures: God will never destroy everything with a flood again. The sign of the covenant would be the bow that he puts in the sky. As the earth is filled again, we see man disregarding the blessing to Noah. Rather than filling the earth, man resolved to build a great tower and city so that they will not be dispersed. However, God confused the languages of the people and as a result, they dispersed. From the descendants of Shem came Abram, who, along with his father, brother, and wife, moved from Ur with the intention to go to Canaan. However, they settled in Haran.</p>
