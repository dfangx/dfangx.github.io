<p>When the army heard that David was grieving because of his son, the day of victory became a day or mourning. Joab&rsquo;s rebuke to David sounded more like a threat, in that if David did not pick himself up, Joab would take the support of the army away from David. In order to return to Jerusalem, David sends out messages to the people of Judah and to Amasa, the commander of Absalom&rsquo;s army. When the rest of Israel heard of what Judah was doing, they began to argue again, claiming that Judah had stolen David away from them. The result of this was another civil war, this time started by Sheba. David tells Amasa to gather Judah but when he delayed, David sent Joab with his men. Joab murders Amasa, likely because Amasa was promised the position of commander. After Sheba&rsquo;s defeat, a famine plagued Israel for three years, the cause of which was the bloodguilt on Saul when he put the Gibeonites to death. The consequence of that was that seven of Saul&rsquo;s descendants were put to death. The era after David committed adultery seems to contain much more political manuevering and strife.</p>
