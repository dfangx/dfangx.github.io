<p>Job proceeds to talk about the pointlessness of life, since all men will eventually die. If that is so, then it makes sense for Job to want to bring his case before God. Even so, Job hopes of a time where like a tree or plant, man who dies will eventually live again. He hopes for a time where God will cover up his iniquity and he will be able to do the work of God. However, he is faced with the current reality that he is right now being crushed and suffering from great disaster. Eliphaz however, responds to all this by reprimanding Job, saying that he does not fear God because he is appealing to God. For people like Job who refuse to repent, there exists only suffering. Naturally, this is terrible comfort for the suffering Job. God has taken everything from him - he does not even have the comfort of his friends. Still, he will continue to bring his plea to God. He will eventually die anyways, so let his blood testify that he is suffering for nothing wrong.</p>
