God reveals to Moses what is about to happen to Egypt, and charges them to go to Pharaoh again. In the miracle that is performed, Aaron&rsquo;s staff swallows up the staffs of the magicians. As Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart is hardened, God&rsquo;s judgement on Pharaoh and the gods of Egypt begin. The Nile is turned into blood, frogs are brought onto the land, gnats cover the land, swarms of flies invade, the Egyptian livestock die, painful boils are put on the Egyptians, and hail, thunder, and fire come down on Egypt. However, each time, the heart of Pharaoh was hardened. His attempts to prove that he had the power to do the same supernatural acts worsen the state of Egypt. The magicians are unable to stand before God after the sixth plague. Pharaoh is bargaining with God by the seventh plague. But through all the plagues, God emphasizes the distinction between those who are his people and those who are not. Although Pharaoh bore witness to the power of God, he did not repent. What was judgement to the Egyptians was salvation for the people of God.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210510190011/>previous</a>
