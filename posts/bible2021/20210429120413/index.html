<p>Abraham had many other sons after Isaac, but the inheritance went only to Isaac. Before Jacob and Esau are born to Isaac, God tells Isaac and Rebekah that the two children are two nations, but the older will serve the younger. We begin to see the first recorded instance of favouritism in a family. Later on, Esau is also shown to disrespect his birthright when he sold it to Jacob for stew. God also reiterates his covenant with Abraham to Isaac, which he has now inherited. However, even after that, Isaac still fears for his life when in the land of Gerar, just like Abraham did, and ends up lying about his wife. It seems like Abimelech has learned from his previous experience though, so a hefty consequence is decreed should anyone lay hands on Isaac or Rebekah. As Isaac grew stronger and richer, the Philistines began to fear Isaac and he was sent away. There were quarrels over Isaac&rsquo;s wells, but eventually, he was able to persevere and dig a well without quarrel. Abimelech and Phicol even go to Isaac to establish a covenant of peace with them. Thus, in all that Isaac did, God blessed him.</p>
