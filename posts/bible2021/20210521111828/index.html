They gave so much that they had more than needed. Because of that, Moses gave the command to stop contributions to the sanctuary. They had witnessed God descending on Sinai and his providence in the desert and they now respond with their contributions. All the craftsmen made the curtains for the tabernacle. They made all the components of the tabernacle, ark, table, lampstand, altar of incense, altar of burnt offering, bronze basin, and tabernacle court according to what God said. A huge amount of gold and silver was given by the people of Israel, and each was distributed among the components of the tabernacle. God provided not only what to make but the means to make it through the pouring out of his Spirit onto the craftsmen. We can see that God allows his people to participate in the worship of him. A God who has thus far demonstrated himself to be righteous, just, merciful, and gracious, allows people to participate doing and making things that will help Israel draw closer to God.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210520191941/>previous</a>
