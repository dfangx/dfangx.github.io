The first son married Tamar, but he died shortly after without a heir. His second son was to raise offspring with Tamar on behalf of the first, but he didn&rsquo;t want to have his brother&rsquo;s offspring. Because his refusal to perform his familial duty was wicked before God, God killed him. Judah did not keep his promise to give Tamar his third son in marriage out of fear, so Tamar deceived Judah into sleeping with her. She stood uncondemned by Judah, for Judah withheld his son from her. In the meantime, Joseph was sold to Egypt, where by God&rsquo;s grace, came into the favour of his master. In his refusal to commit adultery, he was thrown into prison, but even there, God was with him and blessed him. After some time, the chief cup bearer and baker were thrown into prison and each had a dream. God gave Joseph the wisdom to interpret those dreams and both happened as was interpreted. Unfortunately, even after his favour to the chief cup bearer, he was forgotten and continued to stay in prison.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210503204045/>previous</a>
