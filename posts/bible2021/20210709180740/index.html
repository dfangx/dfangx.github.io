The oppression of Israel was very harsh, and Israel cried out to God. This time, God sends a prophet to Israel (the first of their kind so far I believe), and gave them a message that their suffering was because of their disobedience. However, God still did not abandon Israel; he raised up Gideon to save them. Gideon himself did not really believe God either, as shown when he tore down the altar of Baal at night and his testing of God with the fleece. Despite the little faith Gideon had, God still used him to save Israel. God brought Gideon to a place where he could fully trust in God the night before the battle. The battle itself bears some similarity to the battle against Jericho, as it was won by unconventional means. God was fighting for Israel both times. God makes it clear that Israel&rsquo;s victories were not because of their own strength, but because God was on their side.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210709010432/>previous</a>
