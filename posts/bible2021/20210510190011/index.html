<p>Moses continues to voice his fears and complaints. God addresses his first by giving him three signs to perform so that Israel may believe. When Moses says that he is not eloquent in speech, God tells him that he would provide Moses with the words to say. God also alludes that he knows that already and despite knowing it, he still chose Moses to lead his people. When Moses still requests God to send someone else, God gets angry, but promises to send Aaron to speak on his behalf. Moses returns to Egypt. However, along the way, God tries to kill Moses, but it is Zipporah who saves him by circumcising their son. The people of Israel believe when Moses and Aaron perform the signs. However, Pharaoh&rsquo;s response to their request to leave is to make the Israelites work harder. Israel was forced to make bricks without straws. Moses is discouraged at God&rsquo;s lack of action and the people&rsquo;s spirit&rsquo;s are broken, but God promises judgement on the Egyptians and deliverance for his people.</p>
