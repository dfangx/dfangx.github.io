<p>David sought to bring the ark of God into Jerusalem, since Saul did not seek God while he was king. As the ark was being brought in, there was much celebration. However, the oxen that were pulling the cart stumbled, and when Uzzah reached out to steady the cart, God killed him because he touched the ark. David was afraid of God when it happened, and so ordered that the ark stay in the house of Obed-edom. While the ark was there, the Philistines attacked. With David seeking the counsel of God, he was victorious against the Philistines. Because David obeyed God, he was well known throughout the land. David then commanded the Levites to bring the ark of God into Jerusalem, acknowledging that what happened with Uzzah was because they did not worship God according to his law. A huge celebration followed, but for some reason, Michal, David&rsquo;s wife, despised David. David&rsquo;s song gives thanks to God that God has made himself known to the nations. He thanks God that he has chosen Israel, and uses imagery from creation to express the majesty of God.</p>
