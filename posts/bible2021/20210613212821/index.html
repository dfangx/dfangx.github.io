<p>God orders Moses to take a second census. Despite all the disasters God brought on Israel for their disobedience, remarkably, their total numbers were largely the same as the time of the first census. One of the more notable drop in numbers was the tribe of Simeon, whose numbers were more than halved. None of the generation which came out of Egypt were still alive at this point, except for Caleb and Joshua. At this point, the daughters of Zelophehad brought a case to Moses. Their father had died in the wilderness as one of the old generation. He had no sons, so there was no one to transfer his property to. Moses brought this case to God, and God tells Moses to give the property to the daughter. Thus, the order of inheritance went from son to daughter to brothers to father&rsquo;s brothers and finally to the nearest kinsman. As Moses&rsquo;s time to die drew near, he asked God to provide another shepherd for his people. Joshua was then chosen to succeed Moses, and he was commissioned before the congregation.</p>
