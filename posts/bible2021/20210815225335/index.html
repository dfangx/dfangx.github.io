<p>In psalm 25, David asks God to teach him his ways. David is fully aware of how he is, thus his request cannot be made without acknowledging his own sin. In contrast to himself, he praises God for his mercy and steadfast love. David understands that if he turns away from his own path and turns to fear God, he will do well. In psalm 29, David ascribes to God what belongs to God. Among the things mention include glory and strength, his reign over the forces of nature, his authority as king, and the peace that comes with God&rsquo;s blessing. Psalm 33 gives glory to God for his steadfast love. His love comes from his righteousness and justice, and because of God&rsquo;s love, God&rsquo;s enemies experience defeat while his people receive victory. Thus, it is in God that the people of God trust. Psalm 36 continues to sing of the steadfast love of God, emphasizing how precious it is. It does this by contrasting the wicked with those who take refuge in the love of God. Psalm 39 is a little confusing, but David seems to be expressing this during a time of suffering. He does what he is supposed to do, but as he does them, he finds what he is doing more and more meaningless as God is silent. Thus, his prayer to God is to reveal the reasons for his actions. Curiously, David counts himself as a sojourner with God.</p>
