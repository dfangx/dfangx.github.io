<p>God has now fulfilled his end of the deal with Jacob. He has safely brought Jacob back to the land of Canaan and protected him from his brother and given him prosperity. Now, it is Jacob&rsquo;s turn. God brings him back to Bethel, where God becomes the God of Jacob. Jacob officially becomes the inheritor of the covenant, with God communicating this using language from the covenants with Noah and Abraham. Shortly after, Rachel gives birth to Benjamin, but passes away during childbirth. Reuben dishonours his father by sleeping with Bilhah. Eventually, Jacob returns to Isaac, and Isaac passes away. In a show of reconciliation, both Jacob and Esau bury their father together. A genealogy of Esau follows, and he becomes the nation of Edom. The author of Genesis marks a new story with the narrative of Joseph. Joseph had two dreams, in which his family all bowed to him. This sparked jealousy amongst his brothers. The hatred of Joseph went unadressed by Jacob. When sent to check on his brothers, his brothers sought to put him to death but was spared by Reuben. However, he was still sold to his distant relatives, the Ishmaelites, and ended up in Egypt</p>
