Samson was to be a Nazirite from birth, one who was devoted to God. One would expect Samson to live his life with devotion to the law of God, but that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the case. He married a Philistine woman, ate out of a carcass, seemed to have a very short temper - all of which ran contrary to who God proclaimed he was through the Mosaic law. Yet, for some reason, God still decided to use him to save Israel from the Philistines. Even when the people of Judah handed him over to the Philistines, God still allowed Samson to break free of the ropes binding him and slay the Philistines around him. When he was thirsty, God answered his cry for water by providing him with some. Needless to say, this is quite confusing, and simply poses the question: Why did God choose to use Samson, even when he seemed to be breaking God&rsquo;s law wherever he went?</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210711220918/>previous</a>
