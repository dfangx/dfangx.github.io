Moses brought their complaint to God, and God promised to send food. In the evening, they were given quail, and in the morning, they were given white flakes which they called manna. The people gathered manna every morning; none was to be left overnight. The Sabbath was also observed for the first time, a holy day for the people to rest. Yet, the people did not listen - some left manna overnight while others went out to gather food on the Sabbath. Shortly after, Israel complains to Moses again, this time for water. Once again, God responds, telling Moses to strike the rock which he would stand on. In each complaint, the Israelites forgot about their suffering in Egypt and desired to return to the place of slavery. God gave them victory over Amalek, who God promised to completely destroy. Jethro heard of the good things God had done for Moses and Israel. He came to visit, and with the testimony of Moses, gave praise to God. He also advised a system to alleviate some burden from Moses, and Moses listened to him.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210513191404/>previous</a>
