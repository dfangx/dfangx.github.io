Although upright people see his suffering, none have lifted a finger to help him. Bildad seems to take this personally, as he understands what Job is describing to be what he was saying all along. He responds to Job, saying that the wicked do indeed get punished by God. He is implying again, that in acting this way, Job is being punished for some sin by God. Job responds by saying that if he is in the wrong, it does not require any further reproach from his friends but rather, God will judge. He emphasizes that although he is crying out, there is no help or justice because God has allowed it to be so. He is not only alone, but being worked against. Yet, Job still desires to see God and to give honour to him. Zophar, however, takes no notice that Job desires God, and asserts that the wicked will always suffer. He again is intent on convincing Job that he is in the wrong.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210416120517/>previous</a>
