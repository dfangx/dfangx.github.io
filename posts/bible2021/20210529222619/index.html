Because he is holy, the people are also to be holy in the way they live. For example, this involves caring for the poor and sojourner and being honest to each other. God emphasizes that the people are to obey him with the phrase &ldquo;I am the LORD your God&rdquo;, or its variants. In doing so, he makes it clear that holiness is from God and as the people of God, Israel should live in a way that is distinct from the other nations. The punishments detailed regarding adultery differ from other punishments previously given, as it is punishable by death. Instructions for holiness for the priests are given. One of the points is that they are held to an even stricter standard to God than other people. Many things that others can do, like customary practises for mourning, are not allowed. Thus, we see that someone whose entire life is devoted to the ministry of God is held to a higher standard than those who aren&rsquo;t.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210528204213/>previous</a>
