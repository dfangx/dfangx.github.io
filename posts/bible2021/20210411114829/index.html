Both of them brought an offering to God, but God was only pleased with Abel&rsquo;s offering of his flock&rsquo;s firstborn and fat portions. Cain was very angry that his own offering was rejected. In anger, Cain murders Abel, whose blood cried out against Cain from the ground. As a consequence, Cain&rsquo;s livelihood of working the ground is taken away, and he is cursed to wander the earth as a fugitive. From Cain&rsquo;s lineage come the fathers of many of humanity&rsquo;s creation - however, all these were done away from God. Seth is born in the place of Abel after Adam&rsquo;s image, and from his lineage came Noah. At this point in time, every intention of man was only evil, and it grieved the LORD. Only Noah was found blameless before God. God determines to destroy all living things with a flood. He reveals his plan to Noah and commands him to build an ark. In obedience to God, Noah, his family, and a multitude of animals were kept from the floodwaters, Everything else perished in the flood brought about by man&rsquo;s wickedness on earth.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210410115205/>previous</a>
