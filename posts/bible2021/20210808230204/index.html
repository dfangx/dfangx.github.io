<p>At this point in time, Israel approached David in Hebron and requested him to be king. David made a covenant with the people of Israel - his kingship was a covenantal relationship between himself and Israel. He then captured Jerusalem and made it his capital. When Hiram king of Tyre sent materials and people to build David a house, David understood that God had made him king and that God had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people. The Philistines then went to war against David and twice, David defeated them with guidance from God. 1 Chronicles gives us further details of this battle when the author recounts David&rsquo;s mighty men. The author details great victories made possible by God through David&rsquo;s mighty men. The author also recounts the people who came to David while he was being chased by Saul. His men came from all over Israel, not just Judah.</p>
