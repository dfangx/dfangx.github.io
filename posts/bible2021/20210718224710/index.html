<p>Saul is introduced as a Benjaminite searching for the missing donkeys of his father. Unable to find them, he turns to the seer, who is Samuel. When finding Samuel, Saul is given quite a welcome, taking part in the offerings and taking part in a feast. It is revealed that Saul is the one to be king in Israel. Several signs are given to Saul to confirm the validity of Samuel&rsquo;s message - all of them come true. Although Saul had an impressive physical stature, Saul was also humble and did not think himself fit to be king. In fact, even after it became publicly known in Israel, he simply went back to farm on his land. However, when the Ammonites attacked, Saul was filled with the Spirit and brought victory for Israel. God provided a way to solidify Saul as God&rsquo;s anointed. In Samuel&rsquo;s farewell address, he please with Israel to serve God by recounting the turbulent relationship Israel has with God. Israel resolves to obey God in response. Israel asks Samuel to pray on their behalf for forgiveness, which Samuel agrees to do so. He leaves Israel with the message to fear God and serve him.</p>
