Abram consents, even though the covenant with God was made shortly prior to this. Once Hagar was pregnant, she begins to mock Sarai. As a result, Hagar is cast out. However, God visits Hagar in the wilderness, and promises to multiply her offspring as well. He tells Hagar to return and submit to her mistress. Shortly after, the covenant between God and Abram was reaffirmed, this time with the mark of circumcision on all the males in Abram&rsquo;s household. Abram is renamed Abraham, and Sarai to Sarah. God promises to give Sarah and Abraham a child, with whom he will establish his covenant. This promise however, is very hard to believe for Sarah, who laughs when she hears of it. What follows is an intercession from Abraham on behalf of Sodom before God. Such is the relationship between God and Abraham, that at the appeal of Abraham, God would answer and spare the entire city should only a few righteous people were found in it.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210425115845/>previous</a>
