<p>During Joseph&rsquo;s imprisonment, Pharaoh had two dreams. However, no one in Egypt was able to tell Pharaoh what it meant. It was at this time that the cup bearer remembered how Joseph interpreted their dreams for them and told Pharaoh about Joseph. Joseph was brought to Pharaoh and interpreted the dream: God was about to send a famine in the land in seven years. The event will definitely happen. Thus, God blessed a foreign people because of one person who believed in him. Joseph found favour in the sight of Pharaoh and was promoted to second in command. By the sovereignty of God, people who did not know God were able to live through the famine. As the famine progressed, Jacob sent his sons to get food from Egypt. Although Joseph recognized them, he treated them harshly. We see a family broken from actions that occurred years before. Simeon was kept in custody while the others went back. They were told to not return without Benjamin. Perhaps feeling guilt for what had happened to Joseph, Reuben&rsquo;s request to take Benjamin may have been his way of atoning for what he failed to do for Joseph.</p>
