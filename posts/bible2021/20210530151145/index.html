<p>God gives instructions regarding what is to happen should Aaron or his sons become unclean. If that is to happen, that person is cut off from God for a day. Furthermore, only the priests and their household are to eat of the holy things. If anyone else eats of it unintentionally, a fine is paid. God makes it clear that such things are not holy by themselves. Rather, God is the one who sanctifies them. Also, God will only accept offerings of animals without blemish. The people are to do all this because of who God is and that they may not slander the name of God. Various feasts and special days are ordained. The Sabbath is a holy day of rest devoted to God. The Passover and Feast of Unleavened Bread are marked by holy convocations in the beginning and end. God also ordains the Feast of Firstfruits, Feast of Weeks, and Feast of Trumpets. The Day of Atonement is also established and is a time of mourning and repentance. Furthermore, the Feast of Booths is established to remind the Israelites of the booths they dwelled in when God brought them out of Egypt.</p>
