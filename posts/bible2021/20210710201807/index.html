<p>Gideon and his men pursued Oreb and Zeeb, the kings of Midian. They became exhausted on the way, and asked for food at the cities of Succoth and Penuel. However, they were refused as they had not captured the princes yet. Gideon promised to break down the stronghold of the city when he returned with the princes, and made good on his promise once he captured Oreb and Zeeb. Unfortunately, after experiencing God&rsquo;s salvation for Israel, Gideon led Israel to sin. He was offered kingship, which he declined, but made an ephod which Israel whored after. Perhaps this indicated that Gideon did want some sort of leadership in the congregation. After Gideon died, his son Abimelech was made king by the leaders of Shechem. Abimelech killed all his brothers save for the youngest, Jotham. Jotham pronounced a curse on Schechem and Abimelech, ironically on Mount Gerazim (the mountain where Israel proclaimed the blessings of God under Joshua). A chain of punishments followed for Shechem and Abimelech, showing us the high cost of committing sin and evil. The events that transpired show how far human relationships have degraded as well.</p>
