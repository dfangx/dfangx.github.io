Previously, there is a distinction between Jacob and Laban in language and religion. Now, Jacob is renamed Israel, there is separation between the people of Jacob and the people of Esau, and finally, a distinction between Jacob and the surrounding peoples in the story of Dinah. It can also be seen that even now, after having witnessed God&rsquo;s blessing, Jacob still relied himself to achieve his goals. However, we do see that Jacob goes to God in prayer to ask for his protection, for his fear was great. When Jacob wrestles God, there are two things that are emphasized. The first is that Jacob is renamed Israel - this is a sign of a new identity given by God to Jacob. The second is that he has prevailed against God, in that he was persistent with his request for a blessing. There is then the incident with Dinah, in which Simeon and Levi were enraged and set on defending their sister&rsquo;s honour. Unfortunately, they exact revenge by totally annihilating the enemy, utilizing the sign of God&rsquo;s covenant to grant them the opportunity to do so.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210501202229/>previous</a>
