However, the men of the city, in their wickedness, ask the two men for sex. Lot resists, but as the men continue to press harder, the two angels pull Lot back inside and blind the men. Lot and his immediate family listen to the two men - they leave the city. However, his son-in-laws do not take him seriously. Even Lot himself lingered - it was God who had to move him to urgency. Once Lot does leave, God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah with sulfur and fire. Only Lot and his family were saved on behalf of Abraham. Unfortunately, to continue the family lineage, Lot&rsquo;s daughters resort to incest with their father. After all these events, Abraham still fears for his life while in Gerar and lies about Sarah again. But God keeps all parties from further sin. The covenant with Abraham begins to be fulfilled with the birth of Isaac. We see a distinction between one who is born according to the promise of God versus the one who is not - both are blessed, but only one will inherit.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210426114053/>previous</a>
