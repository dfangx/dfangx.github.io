Moses, Aaron, Joshua, and Caleb were greatly grieved, for they believed that God would deliver the inhabitants of Canaan into their land. However, the people continued to rebel, to the point of wanting to stone them. God is angry and seeks to destroy them; however, Moses makes intercession for them, recalling the words that God spoke to him on Sinai. Although God relents from destroying the people, he promises judgement on the people. None of the people who witnessed the miracles in the desert would get to inhabit Canaan. At this news, the people are grieved and seek to enter Canaan. However, in doing so, they rebelled against God again, for God had already spoken. As a result, they were defeated in battle. It is around this time when Moses writes a psalm. The psalm sounds much like an intercessory prayer, extolling the greatness of God, repenting of sin, and an appeal for God to remain with his people. Both mercy and judgement are in his hands - thus, we need God to teach us, so we may know how to please God.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210607194606/>previous</a>
