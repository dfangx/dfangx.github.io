<p>Moses recounts the Journey of Israel after leaving Mount Sinai. When they arrived at the edge of Canaan, God commanded them to go forth and take for themselves the inheritance that he promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Around the same time, Moses appointed men as judges within their tribes, with the duty to judge impartially as God judges. Israel requested to send spies into the land, which Moses allowed. However, on hearing that the people in the land were strong, Israel refused to enter the land, even after Moses reminded them of how God cared for them as a father would for a son. As a consequence, none of the generation that left Egypt were allowed into the land. Saddened, Israel disobeyed again by entering the land, but God was not with them. Israel wandered the wilderness for forty years. They passed through the land of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, their distant relatives through Esau and Lot. Israel was not allowed to take from those nations, as the possessions of those nations were given by God. When the old generation had passed, God ordered Israel to begin the conquest of Canaan starting with the defeat of King Sihon.</p>
