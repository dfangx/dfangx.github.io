<p>Moses reminds the people to remember God. Just as how Israel witnessed God providing for them and dwelling among them in the wilderness, they are to remember God and keep his commandments when they have settled and have received the blessings of God. Otherwise, Israel will suffer the same fate as the nations before them. Moses makes it clear that it is not because of their righteousness that they are taking possession of the land. Rather, it is because of the wickedness of the other nations and the promise God made to their forefathers. In fact, Israel has rebelled against God many times in the wilderness. When they sinned against God with the golden calf, Moses interceded and prayed on behalf of Israel for a long time, fasting for the entire duration. The same thing happened when Israel grumbled against God. At that time, God also gave Moses two new stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written. God simply requires Israel to fear him and obey him. Moses tells them to circumcise their hearts and live as God&rsquo;s people, displaying to the nations all of who God is.</p>
