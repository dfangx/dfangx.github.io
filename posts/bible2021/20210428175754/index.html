Curiously, Abraham tells his son Isaac that God will provide the lamb, although God has not said anything regarding that. Abraham&rsquo;s faith in God is attested to when God indeed provides a ram for him to offer as an offering instead of his son. Soon afterwards, Sarah dies, and is buried in a cave purchased by Abraham from Ephron the Hittite. The story of Isaac and Rebekah is another show of God&rsquo;s providence not only for Abraham, but all those in his household. Abraham sends his servant to his homeland to find a wife for Isaac with few instructions. His servant prays to God and asks for a clear and discernible sign, which God answers in the form of Rebekah. From the testimony of the servant, Rebekah&rsquo;s family also recognizes that this was from God. In seeing God&rsquo;s providence, the servant urgently and eagerly completes the mission he was given - he requests that Rebekah go with him immediately to Isaac. Not only does this provide Isaac a wife but it also provides him with comfort from his mother&rsquo;s death.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210427114307/>previous</a>
