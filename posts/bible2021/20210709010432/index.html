<p>God left several nations behind to test Israel, to see if they would keep his commandments. Unfortunately, as God said would happen, the people of Israel and the other nations intermixed, and the Canaanites became a snare for Israel. In those times, when Israel was oppressed by other nations, God raised up judges. Among them included Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar. Each time, the judge would save Israel from oppression and the land would have rest afterwards. However, once the judge died, Israel would fall back into sin. During a time when Israel was under Jabin of Hazor, God raised up Deborah and Barak to save Israel. They defeated Sisera, commander of Jabin&rsquo;s army. However, Sisera himself was killed by Jael, as Barak did not want to go fight by himself. The song that follows speaks of the victory of God. No one can stand before God - even nature itself falls before God. Curiously, the song seems to indicate that several tribes were called to fight but only a few answered. The song recounts the events that led to Sisera&rsquo;s defeat and how it was the work of God.</p>
