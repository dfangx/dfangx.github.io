However, God will no longer go among the Israelites even though he will still drive out the people there. Moses intercedes again for the people, asking for God&rsquo;s presence to be with Israel, for he knows that it is God&rsquo;s presence which makes Israel distinct from other nations. Moses asks to see God&rsquo;s glory. At God&rsquo;s charge, Moses cuts two tablets of stone again and stands alone on Mount Sinai. God passed before him, showing him his glory and proclaiming his name. Moses requests again that God go among his people. In response, God repeats the previous covenant that was broken and renews it. Nothing was added nor left out, and Moses wrote the Ten Commandments on the tablets. When Moses came down, the people were afraid, for Moses' face was shining. However, Moses calls them near and passes on the words of the covenant to Israel. Israel obeyed God in making all the things that God commanded in the way God instructed. Contributions were made for the materials needed for the priest&rsquo;s garments and Tabernacle. Oholiab and Bezalel were filled with the Spirit to do God&rsquo;s work.</p><p><a href=/posts/bible2021/20210519200932/>previous</a>
