<span class=description>Elihu finally decides to speak up. He is angry at Job&rsquo;s friends for failing to find an answer to Job and is angry at Job for justifying himself rather than God.&mldr;</span></div><div class=post><div class=meta>Apr 21, 2021</div><a class=title href=/posts/galatians/20210421222113/>Galatians 6</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>Brothers need to restore each other in gentleness should any of them sin. Furthermore, while they share each other&rsquo;s burdens, they must keep in mind that they are held accountable to their own work.&mldr;</span></div><div class=post><div class=meta>Apr 20, 2021</div><a class=title href=/posts/bible2021/20210420105822/>Day 11, Job 29-31</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>Job summarizes his defence in three sections. Job wishes for the old days when God blessed him. He was respected by others and honour was shown to him.&mldr;</span></div><div class=post><div class=meta>Apr 20, 2021</div><a class=title href=/posts/galatians/20210420214020/>Galatians 5</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>Christ set us free so we could have freedom, so do not return back to slavery. Paul, a Jew, tells them to not accept circumcision.&mldr;</span></div><div class=post><div class=meta>Apr 19, 2021</div><a class=title href=/posts/bible2021/20210419114446/>Day 10, Job 24-28</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>Job describes the suffering of the poor. Although they do much work, their work is in vain. There are cries and pleas for help, but there is no charge from God.&mldr;</span></div><div class=post><div class=meta>Apr 18, 2021</div><a class=title href=/posts/bible2021/20210418145124/>Day 9, Job 21-23</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>While Job&rsquo;s friends continue to insist that the wicked are brought to ruin, Job counters by describing the prosperity of the wicked.&mldr;</span></div><div class=post><div class=meta>Apr 18, 2021</div><a class=title href=/posts/galatians/20210418221559/>Galatians 4</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>While the heir is a child, his rights are that of a slave. Likewise, we were slaves of the world while we were still children.&mldr;</span></div><div class=post><div class=meta>Apr 17, 2021</div><a class=title href=/posts/bible2021/20210417115051/>Day 8, Job 17-20</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>Job continues elaborating that apart from God, there is no hope. Although upright people see his suffering, none have lifted a finger to help him.&mldr;</span></div><div class=post><div class=meta>Apr 16, 2021</div><a class=title href=/posts/bible2021/20210416120517/>Day 7, Job 14-16</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>Job proceeds to talk about the pointlessness of life, since all men will eventually die. If that is so, then it makes sense for Job to want to bring his case before God.&mldr;</span></div><div class=post><div class=meta>Apr 15, 2021</div><a class=title href=/posts/bible2021/20210415110154/>Day 6, Job 10-13</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>Job continues with a plea to God, asking why God had brought so much suffering into his life.
